# kite.now

## Run it

``` 
node index
```
## Test it

``` 
yarn test
```

## Improve:

- Check for the cloud
- Check for the rain
- Check for the thunder ðŸ˜…
- Calculate media
- Count hours of kite a day
- Probability to go (if the wind is during for 5 days, it's nice!)
- Instead of checking `datetime.between(9, 19)`, we should see for the sunrise/sunset :)
- Check for traffic jam
